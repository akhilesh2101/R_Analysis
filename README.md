# R_Analysis
#### Problem Statement:

Rather than targeting all households or Demographics for all campaigns and promotions, can we identify specific demographics that would make our campaigns cost efficient and produce high returns?

#### Approach/Implementation:

To achieve the above, We identified 3 areas of opportunities : 

1. Analysis on the difference in sales for Total items as a whole and discounted items on various demographic groups to see which demographics are highly sensitive to promotions as a whole.
2. Analysed Time constrained sales on a month to month basis to see which demographics are not following the larger trend to help compound the same with targeted campaigns. 
3. Identified which demographics least contribute to the largest sold products to check the source of the issue. 

And as a larger measure, we also looked into which campaigns were the most successful in the past.

#### Proposed Solution:

From the 3 opportunities we've looked at, we suggest:

1) Targeting income ranges like 100-124k or families with 1 kids for discounted product sales and to increase awareness among higher income groups like 150+k in general since their average sales, although on the higher end, their total sales have been lacking.

2) Demographics like 19-24 age group, 200-249k income group etc have decreasing sales over time as opposed to the larger trend and need to be compounded with marketing ventures. 

3) A lot of demographic specific products can be brought in to compound for the lack of sales in what should be our highest spending demographics. 

### Required Packages

The Following packages were used to do the analysis.

a. completejourney: Retail shopping transactions for 2,469 households over one year.
b. tidyverse: The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. Used for tidying data
c. lubridate: Lubridate provides tools that make it easier to parse and manipulate dates.
